Encore List started out as a way to learn how to build with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Users would be able to create lists of tasks they had to complete and earn points on each one that they do. Built as a productivity app, users will create their own rewards to redeem with the points they earned. This means completing tasks would be primarily from self-motivation.
